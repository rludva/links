# Description:
# ------------
# This playbook is used to deploy the service to the RHEL9 systemd service.
# The service is deployed using the systemd service file.
# The service is started and enabled.
# The service is deployed with the certificates from the <project>/resources/certificates folder. 
# The certificates are copied to the /var/certificates/<service_url> folder.
# The service is deployed with the binary from the <project>/build folder.
# The binary is copied to the /usr/local/bin/<service_name> folder.
# The SELinux context is set to bin_t for the binary.
